# Technique Checklist â€” Shiny Data Entry App

This app was generated from your Excel workbook `2025_updated_U20_checklist.xlsx`.
It creates a tab per sheet, lets users edit tables directly, add/delete rows, and save to CSV.

## How to run locally

1. Install R (4.2+) and R packages:

```r
install.packages(c("shiny", "readxl", "DT", "dplyr", "stringr", "purrr", "glue"))
```

2. Place these files in the same folder:
   - `app.R`
   - `2025_updated_U20_checklist.xlsx`

3. From that folder, run:

```r
shiny::runApp()
```

Data you save from the app will be written to the `./data` folder as CSV files
(one per sheet). You can also download a combined CSV via the **Home** tab.

## Notes & Customization

- All cells are treated as free-text for flexible entry. If you want stricter
  validation (e.g., dates, numeric-only, dropdowns), I can add per-column rules.
- To pre-populate with existing saved data, place CSVs in `./data` named after
  the sheet (e.g., `MySheet.csv`). The app will load those instead of the Excel.
- If you deploy to shinyapps.io or a server, include both `app.R` and the Excel
  in the app bundle. The app will create the `data/` directory at first run.
